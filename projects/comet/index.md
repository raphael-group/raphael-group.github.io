#CoMEt: <u>C</u>ombinations <u>o</u>f <u>M</u>utually <u>E</u>xclusive Al<u>t</u>erations
CoMEt improves upon the [Dendrix](/projects/dendrix) and [Multi-Dendrix](/projects/multi-dendrix)
algorithms to identify collections of exclusive alterations in cancer without prior information. CoMEt
uses a novel statistical score for exclusivity collections of alterations and an MCMC algorithm to
compute the marginal probability of observing pairs of alterations in the same exclusive set.

CoMEt is released as a [software package on GitHub](https://github.com/raphael-group/comet).


##Dendrix++
Dendrix++ is a preliminary version of CoMEt that we applied as part of the
[TCGA AML project](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1301689#t=articleTop).
