# Weighted Exact Test (WExT)

## About
We developed a weighted exact test for mutually exclusive mutations, which conditions on the number of mutations in each gene and uses per gene, per sample mutation probabilities. We call this a _weighted-row exclusivity (WR-exclusivity) test_, because it conditions on the number of mutations per gene (row sums of mutation matrix) and uses per gene, per sample weights.

## Downloads and software
We use our Weighted Exclusivity Test (WExT) software to compute the WR-exclusivity test. We host the software and source code is hosted on GitHub: [Source code](https://github.com/raphael-group/wext/) | [Downloads](https://github.com/raphael-group/wext/releases).
