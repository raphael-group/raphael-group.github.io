# NAIBR: Novel Adjacency Identification with Barcoded Reads

## About
NAIBR is a probabilistic algorithm for the identification of novel adjacencies from whole-genome linked-read sequencing data. NAIBR takes as input a barcoded and phased BAM processed with 10X Genomics' "Long Ranger" pipeline and outputs a BEDPE file containing the predicted novel adjacencies with corresponding haplotypes, and log-likelihood scores.
