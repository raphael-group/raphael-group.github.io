<p><span>
HotNet2 (diffusion-oriented subnetworks) is a general algorithm for identifying high weight subnetworks in a vertex-weighted network. HotNet2 was developed for identifying significantly mutated groups of interacting genes from large cancer sequencing studies. HotNet2 uses an ‚Äúinsulated‚Äù heat diffusion process to simultaneously analyze a gene‚Äôs mutations (or mutation score) and its local topology. This diffusion process encodes the source, or directionality, of heat within the network, allowing HotNet2 to uncover surprisingly ‚Äúhot‚Äù subnetworks with wide ranges of heat scores.
