<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>NAIBR is a probabilistic algorithm for the identification of novel adjacencies from whole-genome linked-read sequencing data. NAIBR takes as input a barcoded and phased BAM processed with 10X Genomics‚Äô ‚ÄúLong Ranger‚Äù pipeline and outputs a BEDPE file containing the predicted novel adjacencies with corresponding haplotypes, and log-likelihood scores.</p>
