<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>We developed a weighted exact test for mutually exclusive mutations, which conditions on the number of mutations in each gene and uses per gene, per sample mutation probabilities. We call this a <em>weighted-row exclusivity (WR-exclusivity) test</em>, because it conditions on the number of mutations per gene (row sums of mutation matrix) and uses per gene, per sample weights.</p>

<p>We use our WR-exclusivity test to approximate the row-column exclusivity (RC-exclusivity) test that conditions on the number of mutations per gene and per patient, but is too expensive computationally to compute exactly.</p>

<h2 id="downloads-and-software">Downloads and software</h2>
<p>We use our Weighted Exclusivity Test (WExT) software to compute the WR-exclusivity test, either exactly or with a saddlepoint approximation. The software and source code is hosted on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/raphael-group/wext/">Source code</a> | <a href="https://github.com/raphael-group/wext/releases">Downloads</a>.</p>
