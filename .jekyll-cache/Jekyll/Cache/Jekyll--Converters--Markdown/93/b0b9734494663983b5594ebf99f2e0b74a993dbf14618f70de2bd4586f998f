<h2 id="about">About</h2>
<p>HotNet is an algorithm for finding significantly altered subnetworks in a large gene interaction network.  While originally developed for use with cancer mutation data, the current release of HotNet also supports any application in which scores can be assigned to genes in the network (this version of the algorithm is called generalizedHotNet - see Vandin et al., PSB 2012).</p>
