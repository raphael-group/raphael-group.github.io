## Ben Raphael Scientific Biography
Ben Raphael joined Brown University in September 2006 as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Center for Computational Molecular Biology. His research focuses on the design of combinatorial and statistical algorithms for the interpretation of genomes. Current research interests include next-generation DNA sequencing, structural variation, genome rearrangements in cancer and evolution, and network analysis of somatic mutations in cancer. Earlier research included topics in comparative genomics, multiple sequence alignment, and motif finding. He is the recipient of a National Science Foundation CAREER Award and an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship.

From 2002-2006, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the Bioinformatics Group at the University of California, San Diego led by Professor Pavel Pevzner, supported by a postdoctoral fellowship in Computational Molecular Biology from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and by a Career Award at the Scientific Interface from the Burroughs Wellcome Fund.

He received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of California, San Diego in 2002 under the supervision of Jim Agler. His doctoral research was in operator theory, specifically on certain problems related to functional calculus of linear operators on Hilbert space.  Many of the results from his Ph.D. thesis "A Computational Investigation of Spectral Sets and Rational Dilations Over Multiply-Connected Domains" appear in this monograph.  

He received an S.B. in Mathematics with a minor in Biology from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1996.  As an undergraduate, he worked with Jim Propp on problems in combinatorics, and worked in the laboratory of David Page at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.
